# What is HTML ?   

It stands for Hyper Text Mark-up Language, and it is the hidden code that is used to create all the webpages on the web.

HTML is made up of tags, each tag begins with a left angle bracket  **<**  and end with a right angle bracket  **>**  left angle bracket

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;left angle&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**<**html**>**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;right angle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tag name

HTML is Hyper Text Markup Language: it is not a programming language, it is a “markup” language it describes what the web browser should do with the text in your document. HTML is the skeleton of the webpage which includes a HEAD and BODY.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>This is a title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Hello world!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

HTML tags (almost) all tags have a <tag> and </tag> closure

Each tag will have a different name and will have a different meaning. There are many tags that allow you to do many things. We will show you some of these today.

Tags are the instructions that tell the web browser where to put things and how to make them look.

The <html> tag is called a starting tag, and usually each starting tag has a closing tag like </html>

Notice that all you had to do to make the ending tag is add a backslash ( / ) to the starting tag.
